# Vim
### Vim is a text editor that can be slightly hard to learn but has many useful shortcuts and is integrated with Terminal.


## File commands

* `vim <filename>` this opens <filename> in Vim. **NOTE**: this will create a new file if no such file exists. **NOTE**: this command requires filepath.

* `:w` which saves the open file,

* `:q!` which quits without saving,

* `:wa` which saves all open files,

* `:qa!` which quits all open files without saving,

* `:wq:` which saves and closes the current file,

* `:wqa` which is the same as :wq but for all open files.

* `:tabe <filename>` opens <filename> in a new "tab".

* `gt` switches tabs in a left-to-right order by using in esc mode.

* `:vsp <filename>` opens a new file in the same tab by having a vertical split down the middle. This is useful for .cpp file .h file pairs. To switch between these files, in esc mode, use alt + arrow key (depending on which way you want to go).

* `:sp <filename>` is the same as :vsp but splits the screen horizontally. (It looks so much worse, don't use it).


## Text Editing

* `i` goes into insert mode, where you can insert text.

* `:%s/<old-text>/<new-text>/gc` finds instances of <old-text> and replaces it with <new-text>, giving a y/n prompt for safety.

* `dd` deletes and copies the current line.

* `p` pastes any copied stuff.

* `o` creates a new line with the same indentation as the old line.

* `Shift+o` is the as `o` same but it creates the new line above the old one.

## Cursor Commands

* `Shift+g` goes to test bottom of the file.

* `e` goes to the next character that is before a space or a new line.

* `w` goes to the next character that is after a space or a new line.

## Visual Mode

* `v` goes into visual mode, highlighting characters, preparing them for other commands. **NOTE**: The highlighter starts from the character the cursor's on and is unidirectional. **NOTE**: The character the cursor is on counts as highlighted.

* `d` deletes the highlighted characters.

* `y` copies the highlighted characters, alowing them to be pasted elsewhere (including other files).

* `esc` leaves visual mode.
